This repository contains a simple demonstration of a company chat application.

## Company Chat

`company_chat.py` is a minimal command line program that simulates a private company chat. There are two types of users:

- **Admin/Boss**: can send group messages or direct messages to employees.
- **Employee**: can read group messages and send a request to the boss to change workdays.

### Running the app

Run the program with Python 3:

```bash
python3 company_chat.py
```

You will be prompted to log in as the boss or as one of the demo employees (`alice` or `bob`).
